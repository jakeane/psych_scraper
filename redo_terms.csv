0,Dysthymia,"A mild but long-term form of depression. Dysthymia is defined as a low mood occurring for at least two years, along with at least two other symptoms of depression. Examples of symptoms include lost interest in normal activities, hopelessness, low self-esteem, low appetite, low energy, sleep changes, and poor concentration. Treatments include medications and talk therapy. "
1,Restless Legs Syndrome,"A condition characterized by a nearly irresistible urge to move the legs, typically in the evenings. Restless legs syndrome typically occurs while sitting or lying down. It generally worsens with age and can disrupt sleep. The main symptom is a nearly irresistible urge to move the legs. Getting up and moving around helps the unpleasant feeling temporarily go away. Self-care steps, lifestyle changes, or medications may help. "
2,Sleepwalking,"The act of getting up and walking around while asleep. Sleepwalking is most common in children, who usually outgrow it by their teens. Sleepwalking usually occurs one to two hours after falling asleep at night. Rarely, it may involve unusual behaviors, such as climbing out a window or urinating in a closet. Often, sleepwalking is a random, harmless event. Treatment may be needed if it occurs often or causes injury. Medications and hypnosis may help. "
3,Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Intermittent airflow blockage during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is seen in all age groups, but the frequency increases with age and obesity. Symptoms include snoring and daytime sleepiness. Weight loss, sleeping on one's side, and decreasing alcohol consumption can help. The delivery of pressure via a face or nasal mask (CPAP) is often prescribed. Other common treatments include an oral device and surgery. "
4,Narcolepsy,"A chronic sleep disorder that causes overwhelming daytime drowsiness. The cause of narcolepsy isn't well understood but may involve genetic factors and abnormal signaling in the brain. Narcolepsy causes sudden attacks of sleep. Sudden loss of muscle tone and hallucinations might occur. Stimulants, antidepressants, and other medications can help. "
5,Hoarding Disorder,"A persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions because of a perceived need to save them. Excessive thoughts (obsessions) that lead to repetitive behaviours (compulsions). A group of thinking and social symptoms that interferes with daily functioning. A mental health disorder characterised by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. A genetic disorder that causes obesity, intellectual disability, and shortness in height. "
6,Major Depressive Disorder,"A mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. Possible causes include a combination of biological, psychological, and social sources of distress. Increasingly, research suggests these factors may cause changes in brain function, including altered activity of certain neural circuits in the brain. The persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest that characterizes major depression can lead to a range of behavioral and physical symptoms. These may include changes in sleep, appetite, energy level, concentration, daily behavior, or self-esteem. Depression can also be associated with thoughts of suicide. The mainstay of treatment is usually medication, talk therapy, or a combination of the two. Increasingly, research suggests these treatments may normalize brain changes associated with depression. "
